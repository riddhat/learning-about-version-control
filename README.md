# Learning about Version Control
Author: Riddha Tuladhar 89795090

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like how version control allows me to roll back changes if I mess up my project horribly (which will likely happen eventually).
I find it frustrating that collaborating wiht others is not as simple as on a google doc and that it will take a fair bit of effort coordinating with you team to ensure that you are not working on the same thing or taking the project in different directions in between commits.
